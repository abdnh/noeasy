No card is easy.

Maybe you *can* answer the card instantly, but that shouldn't be your habit. I myself got a habit of dashing space without even reading the question.
So this addon. This addon prevents me from seeing answers within 1.5 seconds.

1.5 seconds is arbitrary. I know. I think that's a good default.
